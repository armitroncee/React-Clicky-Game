# React-Clicky-Game

See the deployed version at https://armitroncee.github.io/React-Clicky-Game/

This is a game made in React.js. The game is a memory game where you have to click each card item only once. If you click one card item more then once the game restarts and your score will reset. There is a high score function that tracks your highest score.

When you click a card you have not clicked before your score goes up and if your highest score is less than your current score the hightest score goes up as well. Another function that makes the game a challenge is that it randomizes the cards after you click a card.
